    Args:
        bitstring_matrix: A set of configurations defining the subspace onto which the Hamiltonian
            will be projected and diagonalized. This is a 2D array of ``bool`` representations of bit
            values such that each row represents a single bitstring. The spin-up configurations
            should be specified by column indices in range ``(N, N/2]``, and the spin-down
            configurations should be specified by column indices in range ``(N/2, 0]``, where ``N``
            is the number of qubits.

            (DEPRECATED) The configurations may also be specified by a length-2 tuple of sorted 1D
            arrays containing unsigned integer representations of the determinants. The two lists
            should represent the spin-up and spin-down orbitals, respectively.

        To build PCM model PySCF needs the structure of the molecule. Hence, the electron integrals
        (hcore and eri) are not enough to form IEF-PCM simulation. Intead the "start.chk" file is used.
        This workflow also requires additional information about solute and solvent,
        which is reflected by additional arguments below

        myeps: Dielectric parameter of the solvent.
        mysolvmethod: Solvent model, which can be IEF-PCM, COSMO, C-PCM, SS(V)PE,
               see https://manual.q-chem.com/5.4/topic_pcm-em.html
               At the moment only IEF-PCM was tested.
               In principle two other models from PySCF "solvent" module can be used as well,
               namely SMD and polarizable embedding (PE).
               The SMD and PE were not tested yet and their usage requires addition of more
               input arguments for "solve_solvent".
        myavas: This argument allows user to select active space in solute with AVAS.
                The corresponding list should include target atomic orbitals.
                If myavas=None, then active space selected based on number of orbitals
                derived from ci_strs.
                It is assumed that if myavas=None, then the target calculation is either
                a) corresponds to full basis case.
                b) close to full basis case and only few core orbitals are excluded.
        num_orbitals: Number of orbitals, which is essential when myavas = None.
                In AVAS case number of orbitals and electrons is derived by AVAS procedure itself.
        spin_sq: Target value for the total spin squared for the ground state.
            If ``None``, no spin will be imposed.
        max_davidson: The maximum number of cycles of Davidson's algorithm
        verbose: A verbosity level between 0 and 10
        checkpoint_file: Name of the checkpoint file

        NOTE: For now open shell functionality is not supported in SQD PCM calculations.
              Hence, at the moment solve_solvent does not include open_shell as one of the arguments.

    Returns:
        - Minimum energy from SCI calculation
        - The SCI ground state
        - Average occupancy of the alpha and beta orbitals, respectively
        - Expectation value of spin-squared
        - Solvation free energy
